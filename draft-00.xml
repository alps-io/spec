                defining simple descriptions of application-level
                semantics, similar in complexity to HTML
                microformats. An ALPS document can be used as a
                profile to explain the application semantics of a
                document with an application-agnostic media type (such
                as HTML, HAL, Collection+JSON, or Siren). This
                increases the reusability of profile documents across
                media types.

      <t>
              This document describes ALPS, a media type for defining
              simple descriptions of application-level semantics,
              similar in complexity to HTML microformats. These
              descriptions contain both human-readable and
              machine-readable explanations of the semantics.
            </t>
      <t>
              An ALPS document can be used as a profile to explain the
              application semantics of a document with an
              application-agnostic media type (such as HTML, HAL,
              Collection+JSON, or Siren).

      <t>
              This document identifies a registry for ALPS documents,
              and sets a standard for creating and registering ALPS
              document identifiers with that registry.
            </t>
      <t>
              This document also identifies a registry for normative
              human-readable instructions on applying an ALPS document
              as a profile to a document with a given media type. It
              sets a standard for registering media types with that
              registry. It gives some non-normative examples in which
              a single ALPS document is applied as a profile to
              documents with different media types.
            </t>
      <t>
              This document registers two media-type identifiers with
              the IANA: 'application/alps+xml' ("ALPS+XML") and
              'application/alps+json' ("ALPS+JSON").

      <section title="Motivation">
        <t>
                    When implementing a hypermedia client/server
                    application using a general media type (HTML,
                    Atom, Collection+JSON, etc.), client and server
                    instances need to share an understanding of
                    domain-specific information such as data element
                    names, link relation values, and state transfer
                    parameters. This information is directly related
                    to the application being implemented
                    (e.g. accounting, contact management, etc.) rather
                    than the media type used in the representations.
                </t>
        <section title="Describing Domain-Specific Semantics">
          <t>
                        Instead of creating and registering an
                        entirely new media type
                        (i.e. 'application/accounting'),
                        representation authors can create an ALPS
                        document that describes a "profile" of the
                        target domain; one that explains the vital
                        domain-specific semantic descriptors and state
                        transitions. This profile can then be
                        consistently applied to a wide range of media
                        types by server implementors and successfully
                        consumed by client applications. The focus on
                        defining application-level semantics,
                        independent of transfer protocol or media type,
                        makes it possible to serve
                        application-specific representations using an
                        application-agnostic media type.
                    </t>
        </section>
        <section title="ALPS-based Server Implementations">
          <t>
                        Server implementors can use ALPS documents as
                        a basis for building domain-specific solutions
                        without having to create their own custom
                        media type or re-invent the vocabulary and
                        transition set for a common domain (e.g.
                        accounting, microblogging, etc.). Using a
                        preexisting ALPS profile as a guide, servers
                        can map internal data to commonly-understood
                        semantic descriptors and state transitions,
                        increasing the likelihood that existing client
                        applications (those who share the same
                        understanding of the ALPS document) will be
                        able to successfully interact with that
                        server.
                    </t>

        <section title="ALPS-based Client Implementations">
          <t>
                        Armed with a document's ALPS profile, client
                        applications can identify the link relations
                        and semantic descriptors within the document.
                        Client applications can "code for the profile"
                        and better adjust to detailed changes to the
                        response layout, or even the wholesale
                        replacement of one media type with another.

      <section title="A Simple ALPS Example" anchor="example">
        <t>
                    Below is an ALPS document that describes elements
                    of a simple request/response interaction in a
                    contact management application. The profile
                    defines a semantic descriptor called "contact",
                    and three subordinate descriptors ("fullName",
                    "email", and "phone").
                </t>
        <t>
                    The ALPS document also defines a single, safe
                    state transition, to be represented by a
                    hypermedia control (e.g. HTML.GET form) with the
                    'id' value of "collection." This hypermedia
                    control has one input value ("nameSearch"). When
                    executed, the response will contain one or more
                    "contact" type items.

          Implementing the ALPS profile above requires implementing
          the descriptors defined by the ALPS document. In this case,
          there are two "top level" descriptors: the safe state
          transition ("collection") and the semantic descriptor
          "contact". Below is a single HTML document that shows both
          these elements in a representation.

                  An ALPS vocabulary is identified by a unique URL.
                  The URL MUST resolve to a valid ALPS document. The
                  server MAY use HTTP content negotiation to serve a
                  human-readable description of the ALPS vocabulary to
                  clients that request an HTML representation.

                  here? -mca :: I'm OK with that. I just don't want to

                  A client SHOULD NOT automatically resolve an ALPS

      <t>
              An ALPS document contains a machine-readable collection
              of identifying strings and their human-readable
              explanations. An ALPS document can be represented in
              either XML or JSON format. This section identifies the
              general elements and properties of an ALPS document,
              their meaning, and their use, independent of how the
              document is represented. <xref target="representations"/> provides specific details on
              constructing a valid ALPS document in XML and in JSON
              format.

                requirements.  An implementation that satisfies all
                the MUST or REQUIRED level and all the SHOULD level
                requirements is said to be "unconditionally
                compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST level

      <section title="ALPS Document Properties">
        <t>
                The ALPS media type defines a small set of
                properties. These properties appear in both the XML
                and JSON formats. Below is a list of the properties
                that can appear in an ALPS document.
              </t>
        <section anchor="prop-alps" title="'alps'">

                  Indicates the root of the ALPS document. This

                  <xref target="prop-descriptor">'descriptor'</xref> child properties.
                </t>
          <t>

        <section anchor="prop-doc" title="'doc'">
          <t>
                  A text field that contains free-form, usually
                  human-readable, text.  
                    The 'doc' element MAY have two properties:
                    <xref target="prop-href">'href'</xref> and
                    <xref target="prop-format">'format'</xref>.
                    If the 'href' property appears it SHOULD contain
                    a dereferencable URL that points to human-readable
                    text. If the 'format' property appears it SHOULD
                    contain one of the following values:
                  <list style="numbers"><t>"text"</t><t>"html"</t><t>"asciidoc"</t></list>
                  Any program processing "doc" elements SHOULD honor the
                  "format" directive and parse/render the content
                  appropriately. If the value in the "format" property is
                  not recognized and/or supported, the processing program
                  MUST treat the content as plain text. If no 'format' property is
                  present, the content SHOULD be treated as plain
                  text.

                  as a child of itself; that is, the 'descriptor'
                  property may be nested.
                </t>
          <t>
                  The 'descriptor' property SHOULD have either an 
                  <xref target="prop-id">'id'</xref> or 
                  <xref target="prop-href">'href'</xref> attribute. It MAY
                  have both. Additionally, the 'descriptor' MAY have any
                  of the following attributes:
                  <list style="numbers"><t><xref target="prop-doc">'doc'</xref></t><t><xref target="prop-ext">'ext'</xref></t><t><xref target="prop-name">'name'</xref></t><t><xref target="prop-type">'type'</xref></t></list>
                </t>
          <t>
                  If present, the 'href' property MUST be a
                  dereferenceable URL, that
                  points to another 'descriptor' either within the
                  current ALPS document or in another ALPS document.
                </t>
          <t>
                  If 'descriptor' has an 'href' attribute, then
                  'descriptor' is inheriting all the attributes and
                  sub-properties of the descriptor pointed to by
                  'href'. When 'descriptor' has a property defined
                  locally, that property value takes precedence over
                  any inherited property value. Since there is no
                  limit to the nesting of elements -- even ones linked
                  remotely -- it is important to process 'all
                  descriptor' chains starting from the bottom to make
                  sure you have collected all the available properties
                  and have established the correct value for each of
                  them.

                 The 'ext' element can be used to extend the ALPS
                 document with author-specific information. It
                 provides a way to customize ALPS documents with

                  The <xref target="prop-value">value</xref>
                  property is OPTIONAL. The content is undetermined; its

                A document-wide unique identifier for the related

              </t>
          <t>
                The value of this attribute MAY be used as an identifier
                in the related runtime hypermedia representation. In the
                example below the ALPS descriptor with an 'id' of "q" is
                used to identify an HTML input element:
          <list style="hanging"><t hangText="'id' in ALPS..."><![CDATA[
<descriptor id="q" type="semantic" /> 
                        ]]></t></list>

<input name="q" type="text" value="" />
                        ]]></t></list></t>
          <t>
              It should be noted that the exact mapping from ALPS elements (e.g. 'id')
              to elements within a particular media type (HTML, Collection+JSON, etc.)
              is covered in separate documents (to be speficied).
          </t>
          <section anchor="prop-id-name" title="ALPS 'id' and 'name' Properties">
            <t>
            In some cases, media types support non-unique identifiers (e.g. HTML's 'name'
            property) or will allow the same identifier value for multiple elements in the same
            representation (e.g. &lt;div id="search" ... /&gt; and &lt;input type="submit" class="search" .../&gt; and
            &lt;input name="search" ... /&gt;). In those cases, translating that representation 
            into ALPS documents could result in multiple 'id' properties with the same value.
          </t>
            <t>
            To avoid this, ALPS document designers can add the <xref target="prop-name">name</xref>
            property to the descriptor to hold the common value ("search") while still using the
            <xref target="prop-id">id</xref> property to hold a document-wide unqiue value. For example:

                A relative URL with a fragment identifier
                (e.g. "#customer") refers to a 'descriptor' within the
                ALPS document containing the reference.
              </t>
            <t>
                The complete URI to an ALPS 'descriptor' (including the
                fragement) forms an "abstract semantic type"
                identifier. This is a resolvable URI (URL) that can
                be used to indicate the type of a resource; for
                instance, it can be used as the value of the
                IANA-registered link relation "type".
              </t>
          </section>
          <section anchor="prop-id-rels" title="Link Relation Values and 'id'">
            <t>
                A 'descriptor' that defines a state transition
                establishes an extension link relation whose name is
                the unqualified URI of the
                descriptor. (e.g. rel="http://example.com/#purchased-by")
                However, within representations that include the
                defining ALPS document as a profile, the descriptor's
                'id' may be used on its own as a registered link
                relation. (e.g. rel="purchased-by")
              </t>
            <t>
                For this reason, when selecting 'id' values and
                defining 'descriptor' semantics, it is important to
                avoid creating conflicts with existing
                IANA-registered values. If it is unclear whether a
                registered link relation in a representation
                document refers to a relation registered with IANA
                or a relation registered in an ALPS profile, the
                semantics of that link are undefined.

                Identifies a link between the current ALPS element and some
                other (possibly external) resource. Can be applied to the 
                <xref target="prop-alps">'alps'</xref> and the 
                <xref target="prop-descriptor">'descriptor'</xref> elements.
              </t>
          <t>
                The 'link' property MUST define the two attributes
                <xref target="prop-href">'href'</xref>  and 
                <xref target="prop-rel">'rel'</xref>.

                  found in generic representations. It MAY appear as a
                  property of 'descriptor'.
                </t>
          <t>
                  This is used when the name of the 'descriptor'
                  is used as an <xref target="prop-id">'id'</xref> value elsewhere in the
                  ALPS document. For instance, if a single ALPS
                  document defines a semantic descriptor (data element) called
                  "customer" and a safe descriptor (transition element) also called
                  "customer", they can't both have 'id="customer"' in
                  the ALPS document. One of them needs to have some
                  other 'id', and to set 'name="customer"'.
                </t>
          <t>
                  The use of the 'name' property usually indicates an
                  ambiguity in the application semantics. Thus, it
                  SHOULD only be used when creating an ALPS profile
                  that describes an existing design.

      <t>
        An ALPS document can be applied to many existing media
        types as long as there exists an agreed mapping between ALPS and the target
        media type. 
<!-- [TK: point to future mapping documentation] --> 
        <xref target="example"/> gave some informative
        examples of this. Normative, up-to-date guidance on applying
        ALPS documents to existing media types are available at the
        official ALPS Web site (http://alps.io). [I implied earlier
        there would be a formal registry. -leonardr]

        <!--
        [TK just brainstorming here, not formatted. -LR]
        Defining how an ALPS document is to be applied to a media type
        requires defining the following:

        * How to mark up a state element in the representation with
        the name of a ALPS element that sets
        type="descriptor". (Informative example: in an HTML
        representation, any HTML tag that supports the "class"
        attribute may use the name [or URI? -leonardr] of any such
        ALPS element as one value for the "class" attribute. In an
        HTML 5 representation with microdata, any HTML tag may use the
        name or URI of any such ALPS element as one value for the
        "itemprop" attribute.)

        * How to mark up a hypermedia control in the representation
        with the name of an ALPS element that sets type="descriptor"
        or type="safe". (Informative example: in an HTML
        representation, any HTML tag that supports the "rel"
        attribute" ("a", "link", etc.) may use the name or URI of any
        such ALPS element as the value for the "rel" attribute. A
        "form" tag that sets method="GET" may use the name or URI of
        any such ALPS element as one value for the "class" attribute
        of any of its "submit" tags.)

        * How to mark up a hypermedia control with the name of an ALPS
        element that sets type="idempotent". (Informative example: in
        an HTML representation, a "form" tag that sets method="POST"
        may use the name or URI of any such ALPS element as one value
        for the "class" attribute of any of its "submit" tags.)

        * How to mark up a hypermedia control with the name of an ALPS
        element that sets type="unsafe". (Informative example: in
        an HTML representation, an HTML "submit" tag may use the name
        or URI of any such ALPS element as one value for the "class"
        attribute.)

        * How to represent the relationship between an enclosing ALPS
        descriptor and the descriptor it encloses. (Informative
        example: in an HTML representation, a tag marked up as an ALPS
        descriptor may contain a child tag marked up as one of the
        children of that ALPS descriptor.)

        Not all media types can faithfully represent all ALPS
        descriptors. For instance, the 'application/json' media type
        has no standard way of representing hyperlinks. The [details?] of how to
        apply ALPS to such a media type will necesarily be incomplete,
        and it will not be possible to represent some aspects of an
        ALPS profile in documents in that media type.

        [TK could we
        say that such a media type is not in complete compliance with

          To indicate that an ALPS profile describes the semantics of
          some representation document, the representation document
          SHOULD be linked to the ALPS document using the "profile"
          link relation (found in the IANA registry of link
          relations). 
<!-- [TK I changed should to must. -leonardr :: Which
          means no one can EVER use Link header or media-type
          "profile" methods. is that what we want? -mca :: I see your
          point. I meant that no other link relation is
          acceptable. -LR] -->
          If the media type of the representation
          document has no native ability to link to other resources,
          or no ability to express link relations, the HTTP header
          'Link' <xref target="RFC5988"/> MAY be used to connect the
          representation document and the ALPS profile. If the media
          type of the representation document defines a parameter for
          linking the document to a profile, that parameter MAY be
          used to connect the representation document and the ALPS
          profile.
        </t>
        <t>
          A single representation document may be described by more
          than one ALPS profile. If two ALPS profiles give conflicting
          semantics for the same element, the document linked to
          earlier in the representation SHOULD take precedence. A
          profile linked to using the 'Link' header takes precedence
          over a profile linked to within the representation document
          itself. A profile linked to using a media type parameter
          takes precedence over a profile linked to using the 'Link'
          header and a profile linked to within the representation
          document itself.

  <section title="Frequently Asked Questions">
    <section title="Why are there no URLs in ALPS?">
      <t>
        ALPS is meant to describe a service in a universal way. The same ALPS description document
        can be used by many ALPS-compliant servers. Since each service implementation is in charge 
        of their own URL space, ALPS descriptions do not include URLs. 
        See <xref target="draft-ietf-appsawg-uri-get-off-my-lawn-00">Standardising Structure in URIs</xref>
        for more on this principle.
      </t>
      <t>
        When implementing ALPS-compliant servers, implementors are free to use any URL design they wish.
        All that is required is that implementors use the same ALPS profile descriptor 'id' and 'name'
        properties in the representations. When implementing ALPS-compliant client applications, the 
        URLs will be supplied at runtime by the server represetentations. Client apps only need to 
        recognize the descriptor 'id' and 'name' values from the referenced ALP profile document.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Why is there no workflow component in the ALPS specification?">
      <t>
        ALPS is not designed to describe workflows or execution paths for a process. Instead, ALPS
        is designed to describe a shared set of data and actions elements that server MAY implement
        in order to create a service. Each action descriptor (where the descriptor's type property is set to
        "safe", "unsafe", or "idemponent") SHOULD describe a stateless state transition that a
        ALPS-compliant client application can invoke when it is available. Servers are free to 
        implement on the transitions they find useful and to arrange them in any order they wish.
        ALPS-compliant client applications SHOULD be able to recognize these descriptors when they appear
        and are free to act upon them directly, render them for humans to invoke, or ignore/hide them
        completely.
